## What is Statistical Scraping

Statistical scraping is the use of web data in such way that the relationship with the statistical unit is known and classfical 

For example, instead of scraping many websites with possible large amounts data items, a statistical scrape uses the information we already know about the statistical poppulation 
unit to select the most useful web data for that unit.
It often involves querying 

More general, as opposed to bulk scraping, statistical scraping uses a-priori information, e.g., the knowledge contained in registers,
on unit level or higher aggregate level, in classifications or in other metadata to perform a targeted scrape on the web
